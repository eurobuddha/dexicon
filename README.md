# Decks (working title)

A decentralised DEX for **MINIMA ⇄ MxUSD** that runs as a MiniDapp inside your own Minima node.

- **Your node is the account.** Nothing is deposited anywhere. Balances are your node wallet, split into available / in orders / settling.
- **Fast book.** Orders are Ed25519-signed envelopes published to interchangeable relays (a cape inside `parlons-node.jar`). Place, edit and cancel are instant; a fill is one atomic two-party Minima transaction co-signed by taker and maker and final after one block.
- **Resting book.** The PandaDEX covenant book and PandaPools depth appear in the same ladder for makers who want orders to survive their node going offline.
- **Doors for ERC20 users.** USDT in / USDT out via the AtomiX HTLC taker engine. MINIMA and MxUSD holders enter and exit directly.

Design and phases: `SPEC.md`. Task list: `tasks/plan.md`. Approved plan of record (2026-10-21):

> Development software. Real funds, real chain. Every code change bumps `dapp.conf` version (pre-commit hook: `sh .githooks/install.sh`).
